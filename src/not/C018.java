* 給你一組方程式和X求微分後的值
 *
 * Looking throw the “Online Judge’s Problem Set Archive” I found a very interesting problem number 498, titled “Polly the Polynomial”. Frankly speaking, I did not solve it, but I derived from it this problem.
 *
 * Everything in this problem is a derivative of something from 498. In particular, 498 was “... designed to help you remember ... basic algebra skills, make the world a better place, etc., etc.”. This problem is designed to help you remember basic derivation algebra skills, increase the speed in which world becomes a better place, etc., etc.
 *
 * In 498 you had to evaluate the values of polynomial
 *
 * a0x^n + a1x^n−1 + . . . + an−1x + an.
 *
 * In this problem you should evaluate its derivative. Remember that derivative is defined as
 *
 * a0nx^n−1 + a1(n − 1)x^n−2 + . . . + an−1.
 *
 * All the input and output data will fit into integer, i.e. its absolute value will be less than 2^31.
 *
 * 輸入說明
 * 每組測資有兩行 第一行為X 第二行為方程式(降冪)
 *
 * 第二行最後面會先有空格在換行
 *
 * Your program should accept an even number of lines of text. Each pair of lines will represent one
 * problem. The first line will contain one integer - a value for x. The second line will contain a list of
 * integers a0, a1, ..., an−1, an, which represent a set of polynomial coefficients.
 * Input is terminated by EOF.
 *
 * 輸出說明
 * 求出微分後的值
 *
 * For each pair of lines, your program should evaluate the derivative of polynomial for the given value x
 * and output it in a single line.
